Below is a conceptual approach for transitioning your crime statistics from text-based to graphical displays without disrupting your existing data-loading or code structure. I have walked through all relevant files and noted how you currently handle crime data, compute statistics, and display them on the CrimeStatsScreen. The key idea is to replace (or supplement) your current “placeholder” chart objects (e.g. BarChart(ctx), PieChart(ctx), LineChart(ctx)) with real chart-rendering Composables—most likely using MPAndroidChart wrapped in an AndroidView. The rest of your logic (data loading, region selection, statistics generation) stays intact.

Below is a step-by-step plan. You can pick whichever chart type (bar, pie, line) makes the most sense for each statistic. The examples below use MPAndroidChart classes (already referenced in your CrimeStatsViewModel.kt) inside Jetpack Compose:

1. Keep Your Existing Data-Loading & Statistics Logic
Your code in:

loadCrimeData.kt (for raw JSON loading),
CrimeStatsViewModel.kt (for computing your CrimeStatistic objects),
CrimeStatsScreen.kt (for selecting a region and iterating over stats),
can remain as-is. You already have correct filtering and grouping, so the aggregator logic is fine. This also keeps your “compute once, display in multiple ways” approach.

2. Pass Meaningful Chart Data Along with Each Statistic
Inside CrimeStatsViewModel.kt, each CrimeStatistic includes:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
data class CrimeStatistic(
    val title: String,
    val value: Double,
    val description: String,
    val displayChart: @Composable (context: Context) -> Unit
)
Right now, displayChart is something like { ctx -> BarChart(ctx) }, which just returns the bare chart object. To turn it into a real chart in Compose, you’ll want to do two things:

Provide the data your chart needs (e.g. a list of BarEntry, a list of PieEntry, etc.) in the same place you compute the statistic.
Wrap the MPAndroidChart widget in an AndroidView so it can render inside your Compose layout.
A simple approach is to store the “chart entries” inside the same CrimeStatistic. For example, for “Crime Types in region,” you already have crimesByType; you can convert that to a list of PieEntry objects:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
// In computeStatistics(...)
val pieEntries = crimesByType.map { (type, count) ->
    PieEntry(count.toFloat(), type)
}

// Then pass them to the CrimeStatistic so displayChart can use them
CrimeStatistic(
    title = "Crime Types in $region",
    value = crimesByType.size.toDouble(),
    description = "...",
    displayChart = { ctx ->
        CrimeTypesPieChart(ctx, pieEntries)
    }
)
3. Create Reusable Chart Composables
Below is an example of a Pie Chart composable that takes context and some PieEntry data. Inside it, we use an AndroidView to create and configure MPAndroidChart’s PieChart. You can do the same pattern for a BarChart, LineChart, etc.

kotlin
Copy
Edit
import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable
import androidx.compose.ui.viewinterop.AndroidView
import com.github.mikephil.charting.charts.PieChart
import com.github.mikephil.charting.data.*

// Example for a Pie Chart
@Composable
fun CrimeTypesPieChart(context: Context, entries: List<PieEntry>) {
    AndroidView(
        factory = {
            // 1) Create the actual PieChart widget
            val chart = PieChart(it)

            // 2) Do any one-time chart configuration
            chart.description.isEnabled = false
            chart.isDrawHoleEnabled = true
            chart.setUsePercentValues(true)
            chart.setEntryLabelTextSize(14f)
            chart.setEntryLabelColor(android.graphics.Color.BLACK)
            chart.setDrawCenterText(true)
            chart.centerText = "Crime Types"

            chart
        },
        update = { chart ->
            // 3) Every recomposition, load the fresh data
            val dataSet = PieDataSet(entries, "Crime Types")
            dataSet.colors = listOf(
                android.graphics.Color.RED,
                android.graphics.Color.BLUE,
                android.graphics.Color.GREEN,
                // etc. or use some utility from MPAndroidChart
            )
            dataSet.sliceSpace = 3f

            val pieData = PieData(dataSet)
            pieData.setValueTextSize(12f)
            pieData.setValueTextColor(android.graphics.Color.WHITE)

            chart.data = pieData
            chart.invalidate()  // Refresh the chart
        }
    )
}
This snippet shows a rough outline:

factory = {} runs once to instantiate the PieChart and set up static attributes.
update = {} is called on each recomposition to “refresh” your data. You configure the data set and call chart.invalidate().
You can replicate the above pattern for bar charts, line charts, etc. For a bar chart, you’d use BarDataSet, BarEntry, and BarChart.

4. Integrate the Chart Composables in Your CrimeStatsViewModel
Below is what an updated snippet of your computeStatistics might look like. Notice how for each statistic, you pass in an appropriate chart Composable:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
fun computeStatistics(region: String?, crimeData: List<CrimeData>): List<CrimeStatistic> {
    if (region == null || crimeData.isEmpty()) return emptyList()

    val totalCrimes = crimeData.size
    val crimesByType = crimeData.groupingBy { it.type }.eachCount()
    val averageSeverity = crimeData.map { it.severity }.average()

    // Example: Bar chart for total crimes
    val totalCrimesChartEntries = listOf(
        BarEntry(0f, totalCrimes.toFloat()) // One bar showing total
    )

    // Example: Pie chart entries for crime types
    val crimesByTypeEntries = crimesByType.map { (type, count) ->
        PieEntry(count.toFloat(), type)
    }

    // Example: line chart for severity distribution
    // e.g., create multiple entries for each severity bracket
    // or do something more custom if needed

    return listOf(
        CrimeStatistic(
            title = "Total Crimes in $region",
            value = totalCrimes.toDouble(),
            description = "...some textual summary...",
            displayChart = { ctx ->
                TotalCrimesBarChart(ctx, totalCrimesChartEntries)
            }
        ),
        CrimeStatistic(
            title = "Crime Types in $region",
            value = crimesByType.size.toDouble(),
            description = "...some textual summary...",
            displayChart = { ctx ->
                CrimeTypesPieChart(ctx, crimesByTypeEntries)
            }
        ),
        CrimeStatistic(
            title = "Crime Severity Analysis",
            value = averageSeverity,
            description = "...some textual summary...",
            displayChart = { ctx ->
                CrimeSeverityLineChart(ctx, crimeData) 
                // Or pass pre-made line entries
            }
        )
    )
}
Where TotalCrimesBarChart, CrimeTypesPieChart, and CrimeSeverityLineChart are your custom Composables that wrap MPAndroidChart. You already have references to PieChart, BarChart, and LineChart from the library—just do them exactly like the CrimeTypesPieChart example.

5. Displaying Charts in CrimeStatsScreen
Your CrimeStatsScreen.kt is already iterating over statistics and calling:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
val stat = statistics[currentStatIndex]
Text(stat.title, style = MaterialTheme.typography.titleLarge)
stat.displayChart(context)   // <--- This is where your new chart shows
Text(stat.description, style = MaterialTheme.typography.bodyMedium)
That means once displayChart is replaced with a real AndroidView-based composable, you’ll see the actual charts. You do not have to change the rest of the CrimeStatsScreen layout, region dropdown, or the forward/back navigation for different stats.

6. Ensure Logical Relevance of Each Visualization
Total Crimes: A single bar, or a horizontal bar, is simple if you only show one statistic. Consider showing a “trend over time” bar chart if you have enough data (e.g., monthly crime counts).
Crime Types: A pie chart can show proportions of each type. If the user has many crime types, a bar chart might be clearer.
Crime Severity: A line chart can show severity changes over time, or you can do a “stacked bar” to show high/medium/low distribution. Decide which representation best fits the data you actually hold.
If some of your text-based bullet points are still relevant (like “Most common crime is X with Y occurrences”), keep them in description. The chart is a visual supplement.

7. Summarizing the Changes
Do not change how you load data (your JSON and region logic remain).
Do not alter how you store or filter the crime data.
Focus on each CrimeStatistic to also hold the data needed for its specific chart (list of entries).
Create small, reusable Composable functions that wrap BarChart, PieChart, LineChart in an AndroidView.
Wire them up in computeStatistics() by passing the new chart composables via displayChart = { ... }.
Leave CrimeStatsScreen mostly untouched, as your .displayChart(context) call will now produce the real MPAndroidChart-based UI.
By following these steps, you gain full graphical representation (bar, pie, line, etc.) for all the same statistics you currently render as text. This fulfills the goal of “in-depth, logical” representation of your existing data—while preserving your code’s architecture for data loading and region-based filtering.
